            <h2>Homemade Gelato</h2>
            <p>
                Cool, creamy, and smooth — this homemade gelato is a taste of Italy in every spoonful. 
                Made with a simple custard base, it’s the perfect canvas for any flavor you can dream up, 
                from classic vanilla to rich chocolate or fresh seasonal fruits. Once you try it, you’ll 
                never want store-bought ice cream again.

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for 2 hours to overnight.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
